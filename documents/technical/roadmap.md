# RoadMap for technical definition
This document aim to give to the tech lead a kind of template or at least a list of things to think about when defining the technical aspects of the project. It mostly based on previous projects and [this article on stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/04/06/a-practical-guide-to-writing-technical-specs/).


## Existing solutions and alternatives
- define the existing solutions and alternatives (C, C++, etc.)
- define the pros and cons of each solution and alternative

## Chosen solution
- define the chosen solution
- define the reasons of the choice

## Deployment plan
- define the deployment plan (how to deploy the solution, etc.)
- define the deployment tests (how to test the deployment, etc.)

## Code and standards
- define the coding style (indentation, naming, etc.)
- define the code structure (files, folders, etc.)
- define the code documentation (comments, etc.)
- define the code versioning (git, etc.)

## Technologies
- define the technologies to use (C, C++, etc.)
- define the tools to use (compiler, Google Test, lex, yacc, CMake, etc.)
- define the libraries to use (Standards libraries, etc.)

## Environment
- define the environment to use (Linux, Windows, processor architecture, etc.)

## Security
- define the security to use (encryption, etc.)

## Libraries to create
- define the libraries to create (Virtual Processor, Interpreter, etc.)

## Steps
- define the steps to follow (create the libraries, create the tests, etc.)

## Sources
- define the sources to use (books, websites, etc.)

## Risks
- define the risks (not enough time, etc.)
