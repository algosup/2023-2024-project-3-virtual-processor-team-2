## 3. Hardware specifications

### 3.1 Processor

#### Description of the ARM7TDMI processor used in the Nokia 3310

- The Nokia 3310 utilizes the ARM7TDMI processor, a member of the ARM7 family known for its efficiency and low power consumption. This processor is integral to the functioning of the Nokia 3310, handling all the computational tasks and operations.

#### Processor capabilities

- The ARM7TDMI is a 32-bit RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing) processor. It is designed for high performance at low power, making it suitable for mobile devices like the Nokia 3310.
- Key features include a three-stage pipeline (fetch, decode, execute) and a Von Neumann architecture, where data and instructions are stored in the same memory and accessed via the same bus.

#### Clock speed

- The typical clock speed for the ARM7TDMI in the Nokia 3310 is 12.48 MHz. This speed strikes a balance between operational efficiency and battery conservation, a critical aspect of mobile phone design.

#### Architecture details

- The processor architecture includes support for the Thumb instruction set, allowing it to execute both 32-bit and 16-bit instructions, enhancing code density and efficiency.
- It also incorporates an EmbeddedICE (In-Circuit Emulation) interface for debugging, a feature that enables developers to conduct detailed diagnostics and troubleshooting.
- The ARM7TDMI lacks an integrated MMU (Memory Management Unit), reflecting its use in simpler devices where complex memory management is not required.

### 3.2 Memory

#### Size and Type of ROM and RAM

- **ROM (Read-Only Memory)**: The Nokia 3310 is equipped with a ROM of 512 KB. This non-volatile memory stores the phone's firmware, including the operating system and pre-installed applications.
- **RAM (Random Access Memory)**: The device includes 16 KB of RAM, used for running active processes and applications. This volatile memory is crucial for the day-to-day operations of the phone, providing temporary storage and access to data.

#### Memory Mapping and Management Approach

- **Memory Mapping**: The Nokia 3310's memory architecture is relatively straightforward, with a clear division between ROM and RAM. The ROM is primarily used for storing system-level software and is immutable during normal operation. In contrast, RAM is dynamically allocated for executing processes, storing temporary data, and managing application states.
- **Memory Management**: Given the limited size of the RAM, efficient memory management is essential. The system allocates memory for applications and processes, managing it to ensure optimal performance and stability. The approach to memory management is generally static, without complex layers of memory allocation or paging systems typical in more advanced computing devices.

### 3.3 Display

#### Display Specifications
- The Nokia 3310 features a monochrome LCD with a resolution of 84 x 48 pixels.
- It supports a basic bitmap graphics system and character display, with a limited ability to display custom characters and simple line graphics.

#### Display Handling in Emulation
- The virtual processor will emulate this display, including its pixel resolution and graphical capabilities.
- Emulation will focus on accurately rendering text and basic graphics as per the original device's capabilities.

### 3.4 Keypad Input

#### Keypad Layout and Functionality
- The Nokia 3310's keypad includes a standard 12-key numeric pad, two soft keys, a four-way navigation key, and dedicated keys for functions like 'select', 'cancel', and 'power'.
- Each key's function in the context of the phone's operations will be replicated in the virtual environment.

#### Input Processing
- The virtual processor will interpret keypresses in a manner consistent with the original device, translating them into actions or inputs for the emulated system.

### 3.5 Connectivity and Network

#### Network Functionality
- The original Nokia 3310 operated on 2G GSM technology. While network functionality will not be fully emulated, the system will acknowledge the presence of these capabilities.

#### Connectivity Interfaces
- Since the Nokia 3310 lacked modern connectivity features like Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, these aspects will not be part of the emulation.

### 3.6 Sound and Audio

#### Sound System Specifications
- The Nokia 3310 included basic monophonic sound capabilities, primarily used for ringtones and simple beeps.
- The virtual processor will emulate these sound functions to a degree that is feasible within the project's scope.

#### Audio Processing
- Sound processing, such as the playing of ringtones or the simulation of incoming call alerts, will be included in the emulation.

### 3.7 Power Management

#### Battery and Power Usage
- While exact emulation of battery life and power consumption is beyond the scope, the virtual processor will include simplified power management features.
- This may include simulating battery status and power modes.

#### Energy Efficiency
- The emulation will reflect the Nokia 3310's efficient power management, albeit in a simplified form.

### 3.8 Peripherals and Other Features

#### Additional Hardware Components
- Components such as the vibration motor and LED indicator will be represented in the emulation to the extent that they impact user experience.
- Emulation of these features will focus on their interaction with the system, such as alerts for messages or phone calls.

#### Embedded Functions
- Basic embedded functions, including the phonebook and SMS capabilities, will be represented.
- The emphasis will be on replicating the user interface and basic interactions of these functions, rather than full backend implementation.
