## 1. Introduction

This project involves developing a virtual processor and a custom assembly language to emulate the environment typical of old mobile phones. It aims to create a virtualized system that accurately simulates the functionalities of these devices, focusing on general characteristics common to this category.

---

## 2. Project Overview

The project's scope includes creating a generalized old mobile phone emulator. This involves developing a virtual processor with custom specifications, inspired by the typical characteristics of processors found in old mobile phones. The Nokia 3310 serves as a primary example for understanding common features and functionalities.
