## 1. Introduction

This project involves the development of a virtual processor and a custom assembly language to emulate the environment of typical old mobile phones, with the Nokia 3310 serving as a primary example. The goal is to create a virtualized system that accurately simulates the functionalities of such phones, focusing on general characteristics common to this category of devices.

---

## 2. Project Overview

The project's scope encompasses the creation of a generalized old mobile phone emulator, using a virtual processor with custom specifications, not limited to any specific existing hardware like the ARM7TDMI. The Nokia 3310 is used as a reference point for typical features and functionalities found in old mobile phones.
