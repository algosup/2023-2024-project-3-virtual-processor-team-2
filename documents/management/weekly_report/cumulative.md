# Weekly Report - Week 1
[Detailed File](week_1.md)

This first week was focused on the initialization of the project and the planning of it. We also started doing research for the code and the different questions we had. We made a meeting request with the client to ensure the quality of our work and be sure we understood right.
One thing to point out is the fact we didn't have project time, all the works was made on our free time.

## Accomplishments
1. Kick-off
   - The client presented us with the project and what he expects from us.

2.  Specifications
    - We currently have most of the functional specifications ready to write and started thinking about the technical ones.
  
3. Planning
    - The timeline is being to be defined but not written down yet.
  
4. Research
   - The software team has researched informations about C, Virutal Processor, interpreter and tools we are required to do it.
  
## Challenges
1. New team & roles
   - This project started with a brand new team. Additionally, 83% of the team is composed of new students and 66% of the team has never used C and still learning it. 
  
   - Each person has been given a role, forcing us to learn about it and set ourselves in the correct mind, even harder for the new students who never did these roles.
  
2. Learning C
    - Most of our team members never did C. Learning it and more importantly, managing to think correctly about how to use it is quite a challenge, even with a book provided by our school in the library.
  
## Plan for next week

1. Write functional specifications and planning
   - The functional specifications must be write and completed.
  
2. Share our informations
   - Gather informations from the research.
   - Ask to the client to clarify some points
  
3. Being writing of the technical specifications
  
## Conclusion
This project started off well and by working enough we should be able to meet the deadline.
We are confident about the future and eager to see how this project will turn out and what we will learn from it.
