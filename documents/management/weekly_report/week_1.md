# Weekly Report for Week 1

| Week 1 |
| --- |
| 8/1/2024 - 12/1/2024 |

This first week was focused on the initialization of the project and the planning of it. We also started doing research for the code and the different questions we had. We made a meeting request with the client to ensure the quality of our work and be sure we understood right. One thing to point out is the fact we didn't have project time; all the work was done on our free time.

## Topics

1. Read and analyze the call for tenders.
2. Discuss the feasibility of the project.
3. Gather questions from team members.
4. Send an email to the client to request a meeting for answers to our questions and to meet the team.
5. Gather information and start writing the functional specifications.
6. Do research around C programming language and how a Virtual Processor and interpreters work.

## Achievements

1. We analyzed the call for tenders and extracted important information.
2. We made contact with the client and proposed a meeting.
3. We wrote our questions to be able to ask them to the client.
4. We created the RACI Matrix.
5. We started to write the functional specifications.

## Challenges

1. To find a moment when the whole team will be available for a team meeting on their free time.
2. Conduct a thorough analysis of the call for tenders to ensure a clear understanding of the project requirements and goals.

## Plans for Next Week

1. Write functional specifications and planning.
   - The functional specifications must be written and completed.
   - Create tasks and schedule/Gantt chart spreadsheet.

2. Share our information.
   - Gather information from the research.
   - Ask the client to clarify some points.

3. Begin writing the technical specifications.

## Team Mood

The team seems to be motivated, a bit blurry on some points that need to be clarified with the client, and the software engineers are hasty to start coding.

## Conclusion

This project started off well, and by working enough, we should be able to meet the deadline. The client has been contacted, and the first documents have been created. It's a good start! We are confident about the future and eager to see how this project will turn out and what we will learn from it.
