[Cumulative File](cumulative.md)

| Week 1 |
| --- |
| 8/1/2024 - 12/1/2024 |

The first week was dedicated to initiating the project and planning. Researching the code and addressing various questions were also part of our focus. A meeting request was made with the client to ensure the quality of our work and confirm our understanding. Notably, all the work was completed during our free time, as there was no dedicated project time.

## Topics

1. Read and analyze the call for tenders.
2. Discuss the feasibility of the project.
3. Gather questions from team members.
4. Send an email to the client to request a meeting for answers to our questions and to meet the team.
5. Gather information and commence writing the functional specifications.
6. Research the C programming language and understand how a Virtual Processor and interpreters work.

## Achievements

1. Kick-off
   - The client presented the project and shared expectations.
   - Analyzed the call for tenders and extracted important information.

2. Understanding
   - Made contact with the client and proposed a meeting.
   - Prepared questions to ask the client.

3. Planning
   - The timeline is being defined but not documented yet.

4. Documents
   - Created the RACI Matrix.
   - Initiated the schedule planning.

5. Specifications
    - Gathered information to write the functional specifications.

6. Research
   - The software team has collected information about C, Virtual Processor, interpreter, and tools required for the project.

## Challenges

1. New team & roles
   - The project began with a new team, and 83% of the team comprises new students, with 66% having no prior experience in C. Each person has been assigned a role, requiring learning and adaptation, especially for the new students.

2. Learning C
    - Most team members are new to C, and learning it, along with understanding how to use it effectively, poses a significant challenge.

3. Scheduling Team Meetings
   - Finding a suitable time for a team meeting when everyone is available during their free time.

4. Thorough Analysis of Call for Tenders
   - Ensuring a clear understanding of the project requirements and goals through a comprehensive analysis of the call for tenders.

## Plans for Next Week

1. Write functional specifications and planning.
   - Begin writing the functional specifications.
   - Create tasks and a schedule/Gantt chart spreadsheet.
   - Begin creation of the KPIs

2. Share our information.
   - Gather information from the research.
   - Seek clarification from the client on certain points.

3. Begin writing the technical specifications by the end of the week.

## Team Mood

Average team mood rating: 7.75/10

The team seems motivated, although a bit unclear on some points that need clarification with the client. Some team members new to C programming express a bit of apprehension about this powerful language, and the software engineers are eager to start coding.

## Conclusion

The project has started well, and with sufficient effort, we should meet the deadline. The client has been contacted, and initial documents have been created. It's a promising start! We are confident about the future and eager to see how this project unfolds and what valuable lessons we will learn.
