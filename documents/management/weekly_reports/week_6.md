## Team mood

Average team mood rating: 6.8/10

The team mood is currently positive given the progress reached in the project. However, there were struggles  just appears within the team this week that need attention. I need to address these issues promptly to prevent conflicts that could potentially impact the project.

## Conclusion

This week marked significant progress in our project's evolution, the focus on enhancing the assembler, with achievements such as the completion of the Test Plan. Additionally, the establishment of GitHub Actions contributes to our project's efficiency.

Challenges, notably the need for an efficient assembler rework and strategizing binary code visualization, have provided valuable learning opportunities.

The team is doing well overall, but I need to address some recently raised concerns within the team before they potentially impact the project.
