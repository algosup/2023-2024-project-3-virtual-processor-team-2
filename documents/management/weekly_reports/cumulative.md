The first week was dedicated to project initialization and planning. Practicing the code and addressing various questions took place. A meeting request was made with the client to ensure the quality of our work and confirm our understanding. Notably, all the work was done during our free time as there was no dedicated project time.

   - Create tasks and a schedule/Gantt chart spreadsheet.
   - Begin creation of the KPIs

2. Share our information.
   - Gather information from the learning.
   - Seek clarifications from the client on specific points.

3. Begin writing the technical specifications by the end of the week.
  
### Conclusion

The project has started well, and with sufficient effort, we should meet the deadline. The client has been contacted, and initial documents have been created. It's a promising start! We are confident about the future, eager to see how this project unfolds and what valuable lessons we will learn.

4. Complete the functional specifications.
5. Improve team satisfaction.

### Conclusion

The project is progressing forward; we've managed to catch up on our delay for the first two weeks, despite the absence of dedicated project time. However, even though the project has just started, the satisfaction of our team is already below our expectations. We need to work on improving satisfaction and fostering a positive mood within the team.
