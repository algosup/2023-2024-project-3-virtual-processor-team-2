In the fifth week, we decided to change our working approach to enhance VCPU realism by transitioning from an interpreter to an assembler.

## Topics

1. Discussion about the assembler, checking feasibility without a significant allocation of project time.
2. Documents modifications to fit with our new goals.

## Achievements

1. Release the pre-release v0.0.3.
2. Release the pre-release v0.0.4.
3. Update KPIs to align with our new goals.
4. Completed the first unit-test.

## Challenges

1. Continued in our path by developing a binary converter throughout the week.
2. Adhered to our deadline with only one project session at the beginning of the week.

## Plans for next week

1. Finalize the test plan.
2. Deploy unit tests.
3. Complete the assembler.
4. Begin working on the Virtual Processor.

## Team mood

Average team mood rating: 7.6/10

The team seems tired due to a short project session. Many team members worked overtime to align with expectations, creating a lack of free time and increasing the workload.

## Conclusion

Not much project time but a satisfying amount of work done, but too much overtime, deadlines were met.
The team is tired due to the overcharge of work, it can be good to add more project session mainly the friday to debrief about the week with the entire team.
