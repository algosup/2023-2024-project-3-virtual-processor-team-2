## Introduction

A statement of work (SOW) is a document which is the narrative description of a project's work requirement. It defines project-specific activities, deliverables and timelines for a vendor providing services to the client. Moreove, The SOW typically also includes detailed requirements and pricing, with standard regulatory and governance terms and conditions.

## Statement of work


### Project 3 Virtual Processor (IAT2)


### Abstract

The goal is to design our own assembly language and to create the related assembler and its virtual processor.
We started by thinking to an interpreter due to a misscomprehension of the call for tender we started to work in the wrong way until a discussion with the customer.

### Value

The project will cost around 600 hours of work but as an internal project it will not cost any manpower and material fees.

### Scope

For this project we chose to work the closer possible as a real processor with our team of 6 people, including only 2 developers in non full-time due to annexe courses, reducing the amount of project time, we have 600 hours of work to do in 540 hours of project, it will be short.

### Type

This is a school project made to learn and pratice C and train ourselves in difference team roles like in professional environment.


### Payment

As students who will work in internal of a school we will not get paid and the project doesn't require any material to buy, no payment has been planned for now.
